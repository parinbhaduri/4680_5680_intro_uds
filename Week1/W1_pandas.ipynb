    "# 0. What is Pandas? \n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a widely used Python library for data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy-to-use data structures\n",
    "In pandas, the data is typically stored in a data structure called a\n",
    "DataFrame that looks like a typical table with rows and columns (+\n",
    "indices and column names), where columns can contain data of different\n",
    "data types. Thus, it is similar in some sense to how data is stored in\n",
    "Excel or in R, which also uses a concept of a dataframe. In fact, Wes\n",
    "McKinney first [developed pandas as an alternative for\n",
    "R](https://blog.quantopian.com/meet-quantopians-newest-advisor-wes-mckinney/)\n",
    "to deal with different complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the pandas data structure\n",
    "The below is a picture of how data is structured in a dataframe. You can see it is tabular structure with rows, columns, and a (row) index, which is in many ways similar to what you might be familiar with from a Excel or Google Spreadsheets. Using this structure, we can apply operations like arithmetic, columns and rows selection, columns and rows addition etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](img/creating_dataframe1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combines functionalities from many Python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas takes advantage of the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) module\n",
    "under the hood, which is mostly written in C. This makes it a fast and\n",
    "powerful library that can efficiently handle even very large datasets.\n",
    "pandas offers an easier and more intuitive syntax to do data analysis\n",
    "and manipulation using either Numpy functionalities in the background or dedicated functionalities written explicitly for pandas. However, pandas is much more than an easier-to-use Numpy as it also combines many functionalities from other Python libraries such as [matplotlib (plotting)](https://matplotlib.org/) and [scipy(mathematics, science, engineering)](https://www.scipy.org/). Thus, you can use many of the features included in those packages without importing them at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supports data read/write from multiple formats\n",
    "One of the most useful features of pandas is its ability to read data\n",
    "from numerous different data formats directly. For example, pandas\n",
    "supports reading and writing data from/to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   CSV\n",
    "-   JSON\n",
    "-   HTML\n",

    "-   SQL (Postgresql, MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, etc.)\n",
