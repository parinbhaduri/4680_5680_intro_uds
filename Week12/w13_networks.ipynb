    "## 1. Network analysis with NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks let you represent structure and interaction among the components of a system. In analytics, they let you go beyond models that average across individuals/components or treat the population/system as a monolith. Networks are useful when the system's structure is nontrivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "A network is a set of objects (called nodes or vertices) connected to each other by a set of connections (called edges or links). A graph is a mathematical model of a network: usually used synonymously. You can represent a graph as an adjacency matrix to use the tools of linear algebra to analyze it. You can also simulate dynamics and flows on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trivial (simple) network is undirected, unweighted, and lacks self-loops or parallel edges. A nontrivial (complex) network may be directed and weighted and have self-loops and parallel edges. A spatial network is a network that is spatially embedded. That means its nodes and/or edges have locations in space. A spatial network is defined by both its geometry (positions, distances, angles, etc) and its topology (connections and configurations). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - street networks\n",
    "  - airline routes\n",
    "  - rail lines\n",
    "  - capital flows\n",
    "  - spread of contagious diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "We can analyze a network in various ways. To take street networks as an example, you can measure its compactness via intersection density, its connectedness via average node degree, or the relative importance of different nodes via centrality. Betweenness centrality measures what share of all shortest paths in a network pass through each node. Closeness centrality measures the average distance between a node and all other nodes in the network."
